# Web Storage Playground

Forked from <https://idb.zeroliu.com>

The goal is to test IndexedDB performance under various scenarios that the original benchmarks didn't touch on, e.g. reading with or without a lot of records, with or without compressible data, etc.

## How to use

First time setup:

```
$ npm install --save-dev react-dev-utils
```

Compile and run:

```
$ npm run start
```

Then visit `http://127.0.0.1:3000` in a web browser.
